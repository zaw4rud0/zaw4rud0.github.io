      <description>Introduction Hugo is a so-called static site generator written in GoLang, and it&amp;rsquo;s strong suit lies in speed and flexibility. Furthermore, Hugo is relatively easy to use and beginner-friendly. Since a blog is usually a personal static website, Hugo is very suitable for that. In this post, I want to show how you can quickly set up a simple blog using Hugo in Windows. Additionally, I want to explain how you can use GitHub Pages to host your blog, so that it&amp;rsquo;s available on the internet 24/7.</description>

      <description>Introduction Have you ever seen a bot in a random Discord server and felt like you wanted to create your own Discord bot? Creating and running a Discord bot is actually pretty simple and straightforward. Note that in this post, I will be using Eclipse and JDA to create a bot in Java. Furthermore, it assumes that you are a Windows 10 user. Since there are many online resources on how to install Java and Eclipse, I won&amp;rsquo;t go into depth in that regard.</description>

      <title>Adding Inline Math to KaTeX</title>

      <description>In my last post we saw how we can add KaTeX to a Hugo blog to automatically render TeX code. Unfortunately, our changes still don&amp;rsquo;t allow inline math, i.e. we can only render equations in their own line like this: $$\int \frac{1}{x-2}$$ To enable inline math, we can simply open our katex.html partial from the last post and add the following script at the end of the file:
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;document.addEventListener(&amp;quot;DOMContentLoaded&amp;quot;, function () {renderMathInElement(document.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to show how you can add support for TeX so you can properly render TeX code in your Hugo blog. Chances are that you are already familiar with Hugo and with how everything works. If you are not, that&amp;rsquo;s no problem, you can simply follow this tutorial step by step. Before you start, you should check if your Hugo theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t already support TeX, else this tutorial is pretty much useless for you.</description>
